# Overview

In this assignment you must draw the shape as defined by a width and height.
After drawing the object, you must define if it's a square or rectangle.

TBH: In this assigment, I think the teacher was trying to have them explore
loops-in-loops, but it's a horribly performant opportunity for it. As such,
my examples will have the loop-in-loop solution commented out and the more 
performant solution exutable.
