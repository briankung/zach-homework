# Overview

My son is learning to program in a C++ class in college. This repository is a series of my own solutions, to his homework assignments, authored in a variety of languages - some I'm proficient in and some I am not.

PRs are welcome to improve solutions. They should verbosely advocate for why it's a better solution from either a performance or from a language-idio/community best practice perspective. The goal here is _learning_; accepted PRs must reflect that goal of _learning_.

It is assumed these are *NOT* the best solutions to these problems as this is a learning exercise across various languages and various generations of developers.
